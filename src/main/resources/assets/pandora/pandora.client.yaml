# To restore this config to its original values, simply delete this file and start the mod again
# This config is very specific with what it needs for each key
# But dont worry, the mod will tell you if something goes wrong while loading it
# And the mod will even tell you what is wrong and how to fix it
# You just need to look for a message marked [Pandora Help] in the logs (.minecraft/logs/latest.log)
# You can hit <ctrl> F and notepad to find it for you
# If you have any questions feel free to join my discord (https://discord.gg/T4kjkyZUw2)
