add button on worlds menu to recalculate all blocks lighting, potentially dangerous with non vanilla, so throw up a warning, this "solves" the lighting artifacts when changing lighting values without needing too much cpu power in game, should only be used when editing these values or when converting world to pandora since all lighting values are cached
create a utility to load all chunks within a world, update all block luminance values with the ones stored in configs

awaiting testing: the world is dark enough that lava can probably be dimmed without issue

low torch light makes indoor farms harder to do early game, i feel this side effect should be left as is, or made into a config

hip lantern?

light enchantment? glowstone ash and ghast tear paste to become an armor trim instead?

torches burn out and can only be relit twice, after that they turn to ash

ash

glowing armor trim

refil lanterns with phantom membrane, and have 3x slower burn rate

glowstone paste of some kind to augment equipment with light, vanishes on repair and grindstone

render a grue face just out of lantern light range staring at the camera, with the lantern just inside view to the left for the mod icon

option to use entity vs nothing per dimension in config

setup gamerules for select config options

fade light level

particle eyeball monster that lurks in the darkness, multiple floating eye segments? eye stalks?

spawn a light generating whisp when respawning, it lasts 2 minutes and follows the player, or until the player enters the light

so, i just make a block entity, make it extend the block its replacing, and
slip that into the original registry call?

effectively, but you have to redirect the original call (or wrap it) since if
it calls the original constructor, an intrusive holder is created
